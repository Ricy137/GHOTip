## How it's made
GHOTip leverages Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) for secure and anonymous transactions. It utilizes a smart contract system where users deposit tips in $GHO stablecoin into server's vault contract(GHOTip contract) anonymously. Each deposit generates two key elements: a proof and a nullifier. The proof confirms the tip while maintaining user privacy, and the nullifier prevents the reuse of the same proof, ensuring transaction integrity. Drawing inspiration from Tornado Cash, this approach introduces enhanced anonymity and security. Every vault contract(GHOTip contract) would only accept fixed amount of tips in each deposit, and currently we provide 0.1GHO and 0.5GHO, two kinds contracts. By using fixed tip amounts, GHOTip further safeguards user anonymity, making the tipping process uniform and discreet.

### Techs used and where they're located
*Detailed explaining files for local setup is in README.md under each folders*

### zk (under circuit folder, circom, snarkjs)
They're originally written in **circom** and using **snarkjs** for G16 setup.
The main circom files are deposit.circom and withdraw.circom 
deposit_js and withdraw_js folders are automatically generated during the compiling of circom files (deposit.circom and withdraw.circom ). And files under the two folders are used in frontend for proof generation.
The Verifier.sol is automatically generated by snarkjs and is used as a helper contract in GHOTip. 

### contracts (under contracts folder)
Managed by hardhat
The main contract is GhoTip.sol under contracts folder, the rest solidity files are helpers/utils. 
deploy.js is under scripts folder to help you deploy the contracts.
